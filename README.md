# Smart Power Monitoring and Control System

## Overview
This project simulates a smart power monitoring and control system, measuring power consumption and controlling loads through a relay system. It includes circuit design, firmware for data logging, and Python scripts for data visualization and control.

## Structure
- **Hardware**: Circuit schematics, PCB layout, and Bill of Materials (BoM).
- **Firmware**: Code for reading power sensor data and controlling relays.
- **Simulations**: LTspice and Proteus simulations of the power circuit.
- **Scripts**: Python scripts for data logging and a control dashboard.
- **Docs**: Project documentation and setup guides.

## Setup
1. Build the hardware circuit as per `circuit_diagram.png`.
2. Upload firmware using `firmware_uploader.sh`.
3. Run `data_logger.py` to log power data, and use `control_dashboard.py` for control.
